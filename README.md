## 🍽️ About Hain-ly 🌿

Born from the need to address **food waste in Filipino homes**, Hain-ly (from *"hain"*, meaning “to serve”, and *"ly"*, for a whimsical twist!) is designed to be a gentle, guiding presence in your kitchen.

With Hain-ly, you can:

- 🧺 Monitor your pantry with a warm and friendly interface  
- ⏰ Track expiration dates before they sneak up on you  
- 💌 Receive little reminders so no goodie goes to waste

Our goal? To nurture mindful food habits in a cozy, calming space —  
like a **sunbeam-dappled walk through a forest** 🍂🌞

The design embraces:
- Soft gradients and creamy, earthy tones
- Rounded elements for a welcoming vibe
- Gentle visuals that feel like a warm wooden cabin on a breezy day

## 🌱 Current Forest Status: HTML & CSS

Hain-ly is currently a **static frontend prototype**, hand-crafted with love:

- **HTML**: The sturdy trunk and branches 🌳 – builds the structure
- **CSS**: The soft moss and forest hues 🍃 – adds the cozy aesthetic

🎨 **Color Palette Highlights:**
- Creamy off-whites: `#FFFBF0`, `#FDF5EB`
- Warm browns: `#A0785A`, `#5B514C`
- Peachy accent: `#FFD7B2`
- Cheerful buttons: `#FFD869`

With **rounded corners** and gentle spacing, the whole UI feels like a hug from nature 🌸

You can browse the static pages to get a feel for the forest magic that awaits! 🍃
